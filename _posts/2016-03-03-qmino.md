# Qmino

Together with Peter Rigole and Bert Vanhooff I started my own Software Company,[Qmino][0]in august 2008 and I've been working there fulltime since september 2009\. At Qmino, we spend a lot of time on the development and support of a POS system for bakeries named[PanoMind][1]. In addition, we also provide software consultancy and development services to third parties on a variety of projects varying from website construction to the design of complicated Geographic Information Systems. Although we are flexible enough to take on a challenge in any technology out there, we are especially specialized in C\# and the .net framework (including newer APIs such as linq, WPF, ...) and Java (both desktop and serverside).

Summarized, we are young, dynamic, competent, efficient, deliver on time and have competitive pricing. Definitely don't hesitate to[contact us][2]for any inquiries!
