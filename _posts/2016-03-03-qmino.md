# Qmino

Since its inception in 2008, Qmino develops complex tailor-made software for our customers, typically with a complex backend. We also develop and commercialize a REST-documentation tool: Miredot.

Over the years, we have developed mobile apps, point-of-sale systems, software development tools and complex web-bases applications. Although we do use state-of-the-art technologies at Qmino, we always put the needs of our customers before technology. 

Since we mainly develop corporate applications, the vast majority of the software we develop is not available for the general public. We do have some samples of our work available that you can check out.

## Miredot

The leading REST documentation solution for Java, definitely worth checking out if you develop REST services in Java. We integrate in maven and gradle and support all major frameworks (such as jaxrs, springmvc, jackson, ...) out of the box. See [miredot.com][0] for more information.

## Gemeentekaart.be

An example mapping-application, made freely available to showcase some of our work with maps. Upload an excel and get a map of Belgium visualizing your data in return. Try it out [here][1].
