# Welcome to my website!

I'm a software engineer & architect based in Leuven, Belgium. I graduated from the KULeuven with a master in computer engineering (Burg. ir. Computerswetenschappen) and completed my PhD with a thesis on dynamic software evolution in 2007\. I left my Postdoctoral position at the university to found my own software company (Qmino) with two friends in 2009\.

On this website, you can find more information about myself and things I care about. 

See you soon,

Yves
