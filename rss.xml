Welcome to my website!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>
Welcome to my website!</h1><p>I'm a software engineer & architect based in Leuven, Belgium. In 2001 I graduated from the KULeuven with a master in computer engineering (Burg. ir. Computerswetenschappen). I then proceeded on the path towards a PhD, a goal I accomplished in march 2007 with a thesis on dynamic software evolution. I stayed at the DistriNet research group as a Post-doctoral researcher for another two years, during which time I was responsible for a number of software architecture related projects with the industry. Together with two collegues, I founded my own company named Qmino in August 2008 and have been working there full time since september 2009.

In my spare time, I'm an avid traveller, movie-fan, play magic-the-gathering, channel my aggression into a squash-ball once a week and I read a lot of books.

On my website, you can find information about both my professional and leisure activities.

Enjoy!
